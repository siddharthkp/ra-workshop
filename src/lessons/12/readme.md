## CHALLENGE:

- Wrap your application in a `ThemeProvider` to make `theme` a part of props for all styled components (already done for you in `button.stories.js`)

- Use the css utility from styled-system to reach peak tokens

- styled-system uses the same theme-spec under the hood

- Documentation: https://styled-system.com/css (see "usage with a styled HOC")
